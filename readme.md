## 📖 Overview  
This project implements a **Neural Network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** trained on the **KDD Cup 99** dataset.  
It aims to classify network traffic into normal activity or various intrusion categories using supervised learning.

**Key Highlights:**
- Utilizes **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** architecture.
- Trains on preprocessed **KDD Cup 99** dataset.
- Includes data preprocessing, normalization, and evaluation.
- Supports visualization of model performance.
